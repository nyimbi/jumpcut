Jumpcut is a clipboard manager for macOS, providing access to text that
you've cut or copied, even if you've subsequently cut or copied something
else.

Jumpcut has a lightweight, intuitive interface and is 100% focused on
your clipboard, keeping code snippets, email addresses, URLs, and that
sentence that you actually had _just right_ five minutes ago close to hand.

This fork adds a few larger-workflow conveniences. They are off by default;
enable **Hotkey > Enable extended clipping actions and 500-item history** in
Preferences to use them.

* The clipping history can remember up to 500 items.
* Individual clippings can be marked as favourites from the alternate clipping
  menu. Favourites are marked with `[F]` and are available from a dedicated
  Favourites submenu.
* Clippings can be visually labelled from the alternate clipping menu with
  bold, italic, and a small color palette. These labels are visible in the main
  clipping menu, the alternate menu, and the Favourites submenu.
* Clippings can be saved to disk: save a selected clipping to a file, save all
  clippings into one text file, or save all clippings as separate text files.

After enabling extended clipping actions, add a clipping to favourites by
opening Jumpcut's alternate clipping menu (for example, right-click or
Shift-click the menu bar icon, depending on your preferences), hovering the
clipping, and choosing **Add to Favourites**.

I made these changes for my own benefit and have sent a PR. They are most
likely not useful to others and they kind of violate the minimalism of Jumpcut,
but hey - works for me.
